		    <p>This program is a rough simulation of bacteria's habits using random walks. The circles are bacteria while the beige squares that appear are food particles.</p>
		    <p>Bacteria are biased to walk towards these food particles. Bacteria are also biased to walk towards the mouse when it is clicked to create a target. However, the bacteria will ignore the mouse when there is already food onscreen. Food spawns every few seconds. Bacteria grow in size as they eat more food until they cannot grow any larger and die.</p>
		    <p>Press A to re-randomize the positions of the bacteria onscreen.</p>
