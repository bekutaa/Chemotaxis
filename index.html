		    <p>This program is a rough simulation of bacteria's habits using random walks. The circles are bacteria while the beige squares that appear are food particles.</p>
		    <p>Bacteria are biased to walk towards these food particles. Bacteria are also biased to walk towards the mouse when it is clicked to create a target. However, bacteria will ignore the mouse when there is already food onscreen.</p>
		    <p>Press A to re-randomize the positions of the bacteria onscreen.</p>
